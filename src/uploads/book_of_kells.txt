The Book of Kells (Latin: Codex Cenannensis; Irish: Leabhar Cheanannais; Dublin,
Trinity College Library, MS A. I. [58], sometimes known as the Book of Columba)
is an illustrated manuscript and Celtic Gospel book in Latin,[1] containing the
four Gospels of the New Testament together with various prefatory texts and tables.
It was created in a Columban monastery in either Ireland or Scotland,[2] and may
have had contributions from various Columban institutions from each of these areas.
It is believed to have been created c. 800 AD. The text of the Gospels is largely
drawn from the Vulgate, although it also includes several passages drawn from the
earlier versions of the Bible known as the Vetus Latina. It is regarded as a
masterwork of Western calligraphy and the pinnacle of Insular illumination.
The manuscript takes its name from the Abbey of Kells, County Meath, which was
its home for centuries.
