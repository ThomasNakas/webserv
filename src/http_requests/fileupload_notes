<binary file content here>


	Content-Disposition: attachment; filename="example.txt"

	This is a standard HTTP header that specifies the filename.
	Used in file downloads, but also works for uploads.
	More common than a custom header (X-Filename).
	Content-Type: application/octet-stream
	
	This tells the server that the request body is raw binary data.
	No Need for Multipart or Boundaries
	
	The file is sent as the entire request body.
